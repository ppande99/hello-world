# hello-world
my first github repository
I am starting to learn Github through Online tutorials. Yay !!
I want to start developing easy to build softwares on my own in github.
Today I am learning Github Integration with Jenkins.
Jenkins Trigger 1st Attemp failed - starting 2nd attempt
Attempt 3 now - that worked well with SCM Polling
Now trying Jmeter integration with Jenkins using Taurus - that worked amazingly
Going to run another test for performance trend
